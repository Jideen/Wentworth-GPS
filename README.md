# Wentworth-GPS
Small GPS application for navigating the halls at WIT
## Description
**What?**
`Wentworth GPS` is a Wentworth navigation app used by students in order to get to where they need to go for classes or functions. The app will create the shortest possible path between rooms and/or buildings, in order to assist students and get them where they need to be.
**Why?**
We're doing this because there seems to be no good Wentworth Navigation assistant out there at the time of development.
**How?**
The app is written in Java with an assistant application being Android Studio. Using these we plan on mapping all of the buildings and rooms, essentially being able to live generate the quickest path between certain buildings/rooms. Final goal is integration into the current wentworth app, for the greater good of all students.
