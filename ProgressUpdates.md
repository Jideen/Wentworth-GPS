# Progress Updates

## Week 1

### What did your team do last week?
Last week we opened the repository, drafted a plan, and wrote up the 
project deliverables.

### What will you do this week?
This week we are going to all be setting up a project in android studio, 
and creating branches based off each of our individual tasks.

### Any blocking issues/challenges that need to be addressed
No issues so far, besides Android Studio being slightly inconsistent in 
installations.


## Week 2
This last week we gathered some data points and practiced development in 
Android Studio.

We're planning on starting basic UI development as well as starting the 
development on basic mapping in order to use in a future pathfinding 
algorithm.

Currently, no real issues.

## Week 3
This last week we developed a basic UI as well as got a navigation 
skeleton figured out. This includes spinners with data population as 
well as buttons with functions upon clicking.

Next week we're planning on starting the actual algorithm by taking 
mapped data and supplying it with weighted points, and then calculating 
the shortest distance using Dijkstra's algorithm.

No current issues besides research taking a while longer than expected.

## Week 4
This last week we got the pathfinding algorithm figured out. Along with 
having all data points mapped.

This week we're planning on padding out the UI, and making sure all the 
buttons and spinners do what they're supposed to.

No further issues at the moment.

## Week 5
Last week, we finished UI interation, while it doesn't look too pretty.

This week we just need to test the pathfinding and visuals in order to 
make sure they're correct.

No further issues.
